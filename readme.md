## About this addon…
This addon enhances the default World of Warcraft user interface to make more user friendly, automatically perform tasks to make playing the game easier and fun, and to add more security and protection to the player, and to provide more information then what is normally given to the player.

## Information before you proceed…
This addon will not function correctly on foreign (non-English) clients. Only the clients enGB and enUS are supported. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause! There are no plans any time soon to implement multi-lingual support!

## History of the addon…
MhMod was originally made for myself in 2005 and updated for my friends back in 2007 and was a very small script with few options. Now it has grown to be a really large and feature packed script I believe it is ready to be released to the public.

## Configuration…
All of the options in this addon are disabled by default so things cannot and will not happen behind your back without your permission. If you are upgrading from a previous version then any new options implemented in this version will come up as NEW! in blue next to the option name. As usual, these new options will be disabled by default for your convenience. You can set the options by clicking the left-mouse button on the MhMod utility button on the left side of the minimap, by typing /mh config or by opening the commands menu and choosing the Script Commands->Show Configuration Dialog menu item.

## Troubleshooting…
If you have any problems or errors while using this addon then first try /console reloadui and if all else fails, restart the game and that should help the problem. If problems still exist then there maybe an error with the script in which case, please contact me with the error details and what you did to cause this error making sure you have script error reporting enabled in WoW's interface options menu.
