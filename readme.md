# MhMod

## About this addon...
This addon enhances the default World of Warcraft user interface to make more user friendly, automatically perform tasks to make playing the game easier and fun, and to add more security and protection to the player, and to provide more information then what is normally given to the player.

## Information before you proceed...
This addon will not function correctly on foreign (non-English) clients. Only the clients enGB and enUS are supported. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause! There are no plans any time soon to implement multi-lingual support!

## History of the addon...
MhMod was originally made for myself in 2005 and updated for my friends back in 2007 and was a very small script with few options. Now it has grown to be a really large and feature packed script I believe it is ready to be released to the public.

## Changes since the last version...
The changelog has moved to Github, please see 'releases' or commit log for a full changelog.

## Known issues in this version...
Please see the 'issues' tab for issues or contact me directly if you have an issue. Add-on appears to be in normal working order now but some aspects have not been tested yet so any feedback would be appreciated. This means the addon will be in beta until then which may take some time. Also, since Lua and my knowledge of it has evolved there is a great deal of optimisation and tidying up to be done too, so the code as it is, is no where near it's final form.

## Versioning information...
This addon has a versioning system based on the syntax formula of X.Yz, where X is major version of the addon, Y is the minor version of the addon and Z is an optional suffix to describe the state of the addon. The major version is incremented when there are major changes to the addon, such as feature additions and enhancements. The minor version is incremented when issues are resolved and performance optimisations and is reset to zero when the major number is incremented. The state suffix can either be A (for Alpha) or B (for Beta). Alpha means that this addon has been rushed out to release and will most probably contain problems. The beta state means that the addon has passed internal tests, but requires public testing for further evaluation. No suffix at all means the script is (but not garaunteed) final stable release. Whatever the state the addon is, please report any problems you experience to me as soon as possible.

## Configuration...
All of the options in this addon are disabled by default so things cannot and will not happen behind your back without your permission. If you are upgrading from a previous version then any new options implemented in this version will come up as NEW! in blue next to the option name. As usual, these new options will be disabled by default for your convenience. You can set the options by clicking the left-mouse button on the MhMod utility button on the left side of the minimap, by typing /mh config or by opening the commands menu and choosing the Script Commands->Show Configuration Dialog menu item.

## Troubleshooting...
If you have any problems or errors while using this addon then first try /console reloadui and if all else fails, restart the game and that should help the problem. If problems still exist then there maybe an error with the script in which case, please contact me with the error details and what you did to cause this error making sure you have script error reporting enabled in WoW's interface options menu.
